* Hybrid Images
** Introduction
  Hybrid images are images that morph from one object to another depending on
  the viewing distance. Since high frequencies are more visible from up close
  than low frequencies, and the opposite is true for far away, that means we can
  take any two images and combine them, in a way that one will be visible up
  close, and the other from far away. We will be using the approach described in
  the SIGGRAPH 2006 [[http://olivalab.mit.edu/publications/OlivaTorralb_Hybrid_Siggraph06.pdf][paper]] by Oliva, Torralba, and Schyns.
*** Rust
  Once again we are using Rust, but this time we're using the =image= and
  =imageproc= libraries, as they are more full featured than =Photon-rs=. Included
  out of the box with these libraries are ways of applying 3x3 filters using
  =filter3x3()= and a built in gaussian blur via =gaussian_blur_f32=.

  Finally, we also use the handy =rustfft= library, which provides native fast
  Fourier transforms.
*** Text Creation
    In this project, alongside normal photographs, we will also create text
    hybrid images of user input. To do so, we create a function that will create
    a basic text image given a string:

    #+begin_src rust
      fn draw_message(
        msg: String,
        width: u32,
        height: u32,
        x: u32,
        y: u32,
        scale: Scale,
        color: image::Rgba<u8>,
      ) -> DynamicImage {
          // Load font
          let font_data: &[u8] = include_bytes!("/usr/share/fonts/FuturaLT-Bold.ttf");
          let font: Font<'static> = Font::try_from_bytes(font_data).unwrap();

          //Create blank canvas
          let canvas: RgbaImage = ImageBuffer::new(width, height);
          let mut img = DynamicImage::ImageRgba8(canvas);

          //Draw text
          draw_text_mut(&mut img, color, x, y, scale, &font, &msg);
          img
      }
    #+end_src

    So if we call this function and pass in "WELCOME" we will get:

    [[./images/results/welcome_process/bb.jpg]]

    And "GOODBYE":

    [[./images/results/welcome_process/aa.jpg]]
** Creating Low and High Pass Filters
*** Low Pass Filter
    The simplest way to create a low pass filter for an image, is to apply a
    Gaussian blur, as this will average the photo together, meaning that high
    frequencies will be either lowered or removed altogether, while low
    frequencies will persist.

    Luckily, this function is already written for us, so we will wrap it in a
    simple function, where =img= is the image, and =amt= is standard deviation of
    the Gaussian filter:
    
    #+begin_src rust
fn low_pass(img: DynamicImage, amt: f32) -> DynamicImage {
    DynamicImage::ImageRgba8(gaussian_blur_f32(&img.to_rgba8(), amt))
}
    #+end_src

    If we apply this to our "GOODBYE" image from before, with a standard
    deviation of 8, we see we get a blurred image:

    [[./images/results/welcome_process/a.jpg]]

    Why a standard deviation of 8? After some testing, I realized that anything
    above 8 will result in some letters that aren't legible. For example look at
    the E at the end of GOODBYE. It's starting to look like a left brace [, and
    the G almost looks like an O. We could use something less, but the smaller
    the standard deviation, the less blurred it will look, and that means more
    higher frequencies.

    Now if we compare the Fourier transforms of the before and after, we see
    we're successful:

    *Before*:
    
    [[./images/results/fft_welcome/fft_aa.jpg]]

    *After Blur*:
    
    [[./images/results/fft_welcome/fft_a.jpg]]

    We see that in the blurred FFT, the only frequencies remaining are those
    around the edges, which are the low frequencies. Luckily since this filter
    was built in, there was not much for me to fiddle with, except to determine
    the highest amount of blur I could use before the letters weren't legible.
*** High Pass Filter
    A high pass filter is a bit trickier, but luckily we can use the
    recommendation from the SIGGRAPH paper, and create a filter by subtracting
    the impulse of the image, minus the Gaussian blur. The impulse filter simply
    exemplifies the bright spots of an image, so high frequencies become higher,
    and lower frequencies are diminished. As described before, the Gaussian is a
    low pass filter, so by subtracting it, we are removing the low frequencies.

    It'd also be nice to control the impulse filter, so we have a function
    called laplacian, that sets the center of the kernel to some amount, meaning
    we can control how much we want the "impulse" to be:
    
#+begin_src rust
fn laplacian(amt: f32) -> [f32; 9] {
    let mut v = identity_minus_laplacian;
    v[4] *= amt;
    v
}
#+end_src

And then our high pass function:
    
    #+begin_src rust
      fn high_pass(img: DynamicImage, amt: f32,amt2:f32) -> DynamicImage {
          // Create impulse image
          let img_impulse = filter3x3(&img, &laplacian(amt));

          // Create blurred
          let img_low = low_pass(img, amt2);
          // calculate the difference by subtracting one channel from the other
          // Impulse - Gaussian
          let diff = map_colors2(&img_impulse, &img_low, |mut p, q| {
              //Clamp keeps operations in bounds
              p.apply2(&q, |c1, c2| clamp_sub(c1, c2, u8::MAX));
              // Keep alpha at 255
              p.0[3] = 255;
              p
          });
          DynamicImage::ImageRgba8(diff)
      }
    #+end_src

    If we apply it to our goodbye image with 5 as the kernel center and 8.0 as
    the blur we get:
    
    [[./images/results/welcome_process/b.jpg]]

    We see that the edges are now more defined, while the centers of the letters
    are dimmer. We used 5 as the center, as that's standard, and worked best for
    letters after some experimentation. If we compare the FFT of both images,
    we'll see what happened:

    *Before*:
    
    [[./images/results/fft_welcome/fft_bb.jpg]]

    *After*:
    
    [[./images/results/fft_welcome/fft_b.jpg]]

    The difference is less obvious here, but we can see that it seems like the
    image is more grainy, the corners are dimmer, but the center is slightly
    brighter, which makes sense, as that means the higher frequencies are now
    more represented.
** Overlapping images
   Next, we must overlay the images on top of each other. On my first approach,
   I would average the images together. Although this worked, I found that when
   I simply added them together I'd get more of an effect that I liked. The
   reason behind it makes sense, when averaged together, we'd essentially get an
   average of the high and low frequencies, while adding them simply overlayed
   them. I found that averaging worked well for creating hybrid images that
   looked like a combination of two images, but adding them together gave more
   of the distance morphing effect, which I preferred. Our function is
   relatively simple:

   #+begin_src rust
     fn overlay(a: DynamicImage, b: DynamicImage) -> DynamicImage {
         let diff = map_colors2(&a, &b, |mut p, q| {
             // add both channels together, and clamp it so its <= 255
             p.apply2(&q, |c1, c2| (clamp_add(c1, c2, u8::MAX)));
             // Don't touch the alpha channel!
             p.0[3] = 255;
             p
         });
         DynamicImage::ImageRgba8(diff)
     }
   #+end_src

   If we overlay our two images, we should get a morphing image:

   [[./images/results/welcome.jpg]] 

   And we see if we get really close to the screen, we can almost only read
   "WELCOME", which is good since we're so close. If we're far away, our image
   tells us goodbye! As if you're far away, the high frequencies prevail, and
   all we can read is goodbye. Finally, if we look at the FFT of this image, we
   see it's a combination of the past two (note the bright corners from the
   GOODBYE FFT and the diamond zigzags from the HELLO FFT):

   [[./images/results/fft_welcome/fft_t.jpg]]
** Colors
   Something of note of the previous result is that the colors are red and
   green, not black and white like most text. This isn't by accident, as in my
   research for this project I had another thought: red is a higher frequency
   than green, so maybe if we use red for the close text and another color for
   the further, it's results should be enhanced:

   *Enhanced colors*:
   
   [[./images/results/good.jpg]]

   And we see that the welcome disappears much quicker, and the goodbye is much
   more visible. This means that we might be able to get away with blurring the
   GOODBYE a bit more, meaning when we're closer it should disappear faster:

   [[./images/results/best.jpg]]

   This definitely has the most "motion", or transforms the most out of all
   we've seen, but the downside is that the GOODBYE makes you feel like you need
   glasses.

   And finally, we can see the same image but black and white:

   [[./images/results/welcome-bw.jpg]]
** Three images
   Finally, I wanted to see if I could combine three images, and the results
   were somewhat successful. Here is the result without any prompt, see if you
   can tell what the three phrases are:

   *Color*:
   
   [[./images/results/alphabet3.jpg]]


   *Black and White*:
   
   [[./images/results/alphabet3-bw.jpg]]

   Far away it should read 123, closer ABC, and really close should be DEF. I
   found that three images was trickier, as you had to blur the far away one
   more, and the closest one had to have the high pass filter run enough that it
   was a bit dark. It seems to work to me, the main drawback being that the
   transitions aren't crisp, we can see the 123 easily when at medium distance,
   and the 123 and ABC while very close, meaning that it's not super clear. The
   strategy for this was to simply run the high pass filter even higher for the
   "nearest" image, as a combination of the two didn't work well, being visible
   no matter what instead of only at a certain time. I still do like the effect
   that there are three phrases to discover instead of two though. It feels like
   the third phrase is hidden, unless you look closely, while the other two are
   obvious.

   Finally, if we look at the FFT of this image, we see we were somewhat successful:

   *123 after filter*:
   
   [[./images/results/fft_abc/fft_a.jpg]]
   
   *ABC after filter*:
   
   [[./images/results/fft_abc/fft_c.jpg]]
   
   *DEF after filter*:
   
   [[./images/results/fft_abc/fft_b.jpg]]

   *Final*:
   
   [[./images/results/fft_abc/fft_t.jpg]]
